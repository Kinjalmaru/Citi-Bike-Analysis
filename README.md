## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to build a set of data reports to provide answers to city officials' questions about the Citi Bike program in a way that is focused, concise, easy-to-understand, and visually compelling. The Tableau data story answers questions about New York bike usage during the summer and winter seasons, times, locations and demographics to allow Citi Bike to determine the best approach to further increase ridership growth and overall revenue.

## Technologies
Tableau
Python

## Project Description
The 2017 summer and winter data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs was aggregated and used to build a Tableau data story which answers questions about New York bike usage during the summer and winter seasons, times, locations and demographics.

## Data
The data used in the project was obtained from the Citi Bike Trip History logs from the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike). The data covers all the months of 2017. The data includes:

Trip Duration (seconds)
Start Time and Date
Stop Time and Date
Start Station Name
End Station Name
Station ID
Station Lat/Long
Bike ID
User Type (Customer = 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member)
Gender (Zero=unknown; 1=male; 2=female)
Year of Birth

## Questions Being Explored
* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

* By what percentage has total ridership grown?

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?
